# Intermittent JSON Parsing Failure in Express.js

This repository demonstrates a bug where an Express.js application intermittently fails to parse JSON request bodies.  The issue is inconsistent; sometimes requests are parsed correctly, other times `req.body` remains empty.

## Bug Description

The application uses `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON bodies. However, under unknown conditions, the middleware appears to fail to parse the request correctly, leading to unexpected behavior in the route handler.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a POST request to `/users` with a JSON payload (e.g., using curl or Postman).
5. Observe that the response is sometimes correct (returning the new user), and other times incorrect (possibly returning a 500 error or a response showing `req.body` is empty).

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `express.json()` middleware is correctly configured and positioned in the middleware stack. The solution file demonstrates how to properly setup the middleware for reliable JSON parsing.
